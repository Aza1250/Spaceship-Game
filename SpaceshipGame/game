# The game script, also known as the main function in some languages is
# the entrance to our game. Here we can set what's known as global
# variables, which we can use anywhere within our game!

# Here we can also set our 'rooms', which you can think of as levels in
# our game! By setting our first level to 'rm_level1', we can change the
# difficulty of our game and add new features to make the game different
# as we play it.
room_set('rm_level1')

# Score is one of those variables, as we need and keep track of it from
# other parts of our game: for example in 'obj_enemy', where we add 5
# points to our score if we destroy an enemy!
score = 0

# Shotgun variable is used to determine if our spaceship has picked up
# the shotgun powerup or no. If it's set to 0, that means that we
# don't have a shotgun powerup equipped yet. If it's set to 1, that
# means that we are using a shotgun!
shotgun = 0
