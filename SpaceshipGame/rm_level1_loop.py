# Here we keep track of everything happening in our leve1 game room!

# Because we want to constantly be checking if have gained 50 point or
# more to win, we put this code inside of a 'loop'. Here the code will
# work all the time and not just once, until we have completed our level
# by getting 50 points or more.

# We use what's known as an 'if-statement', to check if our game.score
# (which if you remember, we can use from anywhere in our game, because
# it's a global variable) is 50 points or more.
if game.score >= 50:
  # Once we hit 50 points, we 'print', or display our message "You win!"
  # and switch our game rooms or levels to the victory room!
  print("You win!")
  room_set('rm_victory')
